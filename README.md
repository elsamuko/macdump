Dumping the process memory of a simple program shows some private keys and certificates, probably for testing.
I couldn't find any reference to these certificates, though.

These are some subjects from the cert:
Subject: C=US, O=Skank, OU=Apple Secure Boot Certification Authority, CN=Skank Secure Boot
Subject: C=US, O=Apple Inc., OU=ETS, CN=H6-LocalSigningTool-ManifestKey-RevB
Subject: C=US, O=Apple Inc., OU=ETS, CN=H6-Mfg-LocalSigningTool-ManifestKey-RevC
Subject: O=Maverick, CN=Test Attestation CA (951f939b-bbbc-4574-99f5-4a17c7874c1d), ST=California
Subject: O=Maverick, OU=07 0000 SHA-1, OU=01 0000000000000003 SW_ID, CN=Test DBL Attestation Cert (ab116bac-07f6-48aa-a0ca-e6ef9a5f5a95)

The only hit for "Skank Secure Boot" on Google is/was this tweet:
